# RPi-SenseHat-Digital-Clock-and-Weather-Station
### This is a quick and easy project to make, and a nice display to show off. It displays both the time, wheather conditions and temperature.
###The code is based on StuffWithKirby's code on reading JSON weather data in python, and SteveAmor on Github's super cool SenseHat digital clock code.
